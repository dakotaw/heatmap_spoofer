## Rigor Mortis (band)

Rigor Mortis is a thrash/speed metal band that formed in 1983 in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas metroplex. Two schoolmates Harden Harrison (drums) and Casey Orr (bass) formed the band when they met Mike Scaccia (guitar). The three young men shared an interest in horror/gore films and very heavy music. With Bruce Corbitt on vocals they created some of the heaviest thrash metal at the time often flirting with death metal. They were also one of the only major thrash bands from Texas and virtually created the underground metal scene there. The band was signed by Capitol Records in 1987.
In 2005, the original lineup reunited and performed at Ozzfest 2008 in Texas. In 2009, Rigor Mortis played in Germany at the Keep It True Festival.
Rigor Mortis recently recorded their first album with the original lineup in 25 years. The album will be called "Slaves To The Grave" and it will be released on October 7, 2014.
Mike Scaccia also played guitar with industrial metal band Ministry, Revolting Cocks, Lard, and others.
Casey Orr also plays bass in the shock rock band GWAR, as the character Beefcake the Mighty. He also played bass for Dallas punk rock band The Hellions. He currently plays for Warbeast.
Harden Harrison also plays drums with the metal bands Speedealer and Mitra.
Bruce Corbitt also sings for the thrash metal band Warbeast (Formerly Texas Metal Alliance). The band is signed by Philip Anselmo's label Housecore Records and their debut album "Krush The Enemy" was released April 27, 2010. Warbeast's next release was a split album with Philip Anselmo's solo material called "War Of The Gargantuas" and it was released Jan 8th, 2013. Warbeast's 2nd full-length album is called "Destroy" and it was released in 2013.
Former Rigor Mortis vocalist/guitarist Doyle Bright now plays guitar in the metal band Hallows Eve.
There was also a Rigor Mortis from New York that evolved into Immolation as well as a Los Angeles punk band named Rigormortis.
Rigor Mortis is featured on the shirt of the creature on the Toxic Holocaust album Evil Never Dies from 2003.
On December 23, 2012, the band's guitarist Mike Scaccia died from a heart attack while performing onstage.
On October 6, 2014 Rigor Mortis will release their final album "Slaves to the Grave". Recorded in February 2012 at MINISTRY's 13th Planet Studios in El Paso. With no label interested in the album, Rigor Mortis successfully "crowd funded" the new album raising $22,838 from fan preorders to self-release the final album.
The Remaining members perform Rigor Mortis music under the moniker "Wizards of Gore" in tribute to Mike Scaccia.
