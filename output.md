## Stanley Odd Jobs

The Stanley #1 Odd Jobs was a tool produced by the Stanley Works from 1888 to the 1930s. It combined features of sundry tools, in a single pocketable tool, including:
Try square
Mitre square
T-square
Marking gauge
Mortise gauge
Depth gauge
Mitre level
Spirit level and plumb
Beam compass
Inside square
Precision steel ruler
The name Odd Jobs denotes that the tool does many kinds of sundry tool roles. Its closest cousin among common, modern tools, is the combination square, which shares with the Odd Job the functions of scribing, squaring, level/plumb, and the sliding and locking precision steel ruler. However, the Odd Jobs still has some unique functions in its total package, including the compass, and compensated gauging.
Reproductions of the Odd Jobs have been made and/or sold by various vendors, including Harbor Freight,and Rockler, currently only GarretWade still stocks them. It has something of a cult following among woodworkers.
