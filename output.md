## Empire Diner

The Empire Diner is a restaurant in New York City that launched a vogue for upscale retro diners, and whose Art Moderne exterior became an iconic image in numerous films and television programs.
Constructed by the Fodero Dining Car Company in 1946 and operating as a Manhattan diner until being abandoned years later, it was refurbished in 1976, with additions including a stylized Empire State Building outline on its roof. It became a city fixture and an artists' nexus from then on. The restaurant closed on May 15, 2010, and The Highliner opened briefly in its space that same year. The restaurant reopened under the name Empire Diner, under executive chef Amanda Freitag, in January 2014.
