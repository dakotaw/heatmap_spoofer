## MuPDF

MuPDF is a free and open-source software framework written in C that implements a PDF, XPS, and EPUB parsing and rendering engine. It is used primarily to render pages into bitmaps, but also provides support for other operations such as searching and listing the table of contents and hyperlinks.
The focus of MuPDF is on speed, small code size, and high-quality anti-aliased rendering. Since the 1.2 release, MuPDF has optional support for interactive features such as form filling, JavaScript and transitions.
The library ships with a rudimentary X11 and Windows viewer, and a set of command-line tools for batch rendering (mutool draw), examining the file structure (mutool show), and rewriting files (mutool clean). Later versions also have a Javascript interpreter (mutool run) that allows for running scripts to create and edit PDF files.
A number of free software applications use MuPDF to render PDF documents, the most notable being Sumatra PDF. MuPDF is also available as a package for most Unix-like operating system distributions.
Independent parties have ported the library to many platforms, including the Amazon Kindle, HP Touchpad, PlayStation Portable, Wii, and DOS.
