The 1st Helicopter Squadron is a United States Air Force unit based at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland assigned to the 811th Operations Group, 11th Wing that supports Washington D.C. Capitol area airlift for the Executive Branch, high-ranking dignitaries, high-ranking military leaders and other VIPs. The squadron is tasked to support key government officials as well as search and rescue missions. Currently the squadron operates UH-1N Huey helicopters acquired in the early 1970s.
