Lane was a 168 cm rover and handy goalkicker. His best season came in 1954 when he won the South Melbourne Best and Fairest award and finished equal 3rd in the Brownlow Medal. He topped the club's goal kicking in both 1954 and 1955.ash concentration are 1) Cash control 2) Cash visibility
For example, you have 2 bank accounts (i.e. Rizabank and Bank Islam). For each of these bank accounts, you set a minimum of RM10,000. In the actual account, it appears Rizabank has RM15,000 while Bank Islam has RM20,000. The difference RM5,000 (from Rizabank) and RM10,000 (from Bank Islam) will be transferred to Bank Account C. This increases the possibility of using the surplus for other uses.
