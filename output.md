David Williamst so impressive, making 3 errors on 10 total chances. The Browns lost the game to the Chicago White Sox, 9–1. Jansens' 4 for 5 is still the record for the most hits in a one-game Major League Baseball career.
Jansen did not play professionally in 1911, but he signed a minor league contract in 1913 and played minor league ball for 5 years, but never again batted over .300 for a season. His major league lifetime batting average remains at .800, but his fielding average was a less impressive .700.
