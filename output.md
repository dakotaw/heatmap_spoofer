## Jamalpur Gymkhana

The Jamalpur Gymkhana (Hindi: जमालपुर जिमख़ाना), often referred to as Gymkhana (or merely Gym) by its members, is a hostel for young apprentice officers of the Indian Railways. It is also a club like any other Gymkhana. The difference is that membership to this club is restricted only to those who spend their formative years in its corridors. It is difficult to talk about Gymkhana without quickly moving on to the anecdotal history of its members - current and past, referred to as Gymmies by its inmates.
