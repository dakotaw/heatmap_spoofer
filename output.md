## Road to the Kentucky Oaks

The Road to the Kentucky Oaks is a points system by which three-year-old fillies qualify for the Kentucky Oaks. It features roughly 30 stakes races for 2 and 3-year-old thoroughbred fillies â€“ the number and specific races have varied slightly over the years. The point system replaces the previous qualifying system which was based on graded stakes earnings.
