## Gramophone Company

This article is about the company which operated the HMV record label.
For the HMV Records label, see His Master's Voice.
The Gramophone Company, based in the United Kingdom, was one of the early recording companies, and was the parent organisation for the famous "His Master's Voice" (HMV) label. Although the company merged with the Columbia Graphophone Company in 1931 to form Electric and Musical Industries Limited (EMI), its name "The Gramophone Company Limited" continued in the UK into the 1970s, appearing on sleeves and labels of records (such as The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd, vinyl copies of which bear the copyright notice "Â©1973 The Gramophone Company, Ltd.").
