## Cycling in Melbourne

Cycling in Melbourne, Victoria is common for recreation, commuting and sport. The city has an extensive network of off-road bicycle paths, as well as designated bicycle lanes on many streets. There is an active cycling culture enhanced by a relatively flat topography, and a generally mild climate.
Cycling in Melbourne was a very popular form of transport at the turn of the 19th century, however mass car-ownership saw a dramatic decline in cycling during the 20th century. The introduction of helmet legislation in the early 1990s also had a significant negative effect on its popularity. In the 21st century, cycling for health, fitness, and as a non-polluting alternative to the automobile has begun to increase in popularity once again, though cycling's transport modal share still accounts for only around 2% of all trips throughout the metropolitan area.
Victorian government policy generally favours bicycle-friendly projects, however in 2008 a new regulation was introduced banning the carriage of bicycles on suburban trains during peak periods. This regulation was rescinded several months later after an outcry from bicycle users.
There has been some recovery in the Central Business District of the City of Melbourne (population appx 70K) where figures put cycling at 8% of all peak-hour (7am-10am) commuter traffic. Planning for improvements to CBD bicycles routes and other major arterial routes is underway. The projects, including a bicycle hire system, similar to VÃ©lib' in Paris, commenced in June 2010.
