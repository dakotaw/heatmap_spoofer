## Åsmund Grøver Aukrust

Åsmund Grøver Aukrust (born 28 February 1985) is a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party. He is member of Parliament from Akershus county, first elected at the Norwegian parliament election in 2013. He was the deputy leader of the Workers' Youth League (AUF) from 2010 to 2014. He was also deputy member of the Parliament of Norway for the term 2009–2013.iscovered in 1902, when Kirsopp Lake (1872–1946) published Codex 1 of the Gospels and its Allies (118, 131, 209), and established the existence of a new textual family. This group of manuscripts was based on four minuscules (1, 118, 131, 209), but now we consider 205, 205abs, 872 (in Mark only), 884 (in part), 1582, 2193, and 2542 (in part) to be members of the family.
The most obvious characteristic of the Lake Group is that these manuscripts placed Pericope adulterae (John 7:53-8:11) after John 21:25. Manuscripts of this family include the Longer ending of Mark to the text, but the manuscripts 1 and 1582 contain a scholion that brings into question the authenticity of Mark 16:9-20: Εν τισι μεν των αντιγραφων εως ωδε πληρουται ο ευαγγελιστης εως ου και Ευσεβιος ο Παμφιλου εκανονισεν εν πολλοις δε και ταυτα φερεται. (In some of the copies the evangelist is completed to this point, to which point also Eusebius Pamphili made his canons. But in many these [verses] are also found.)
In Mark 6:51, the word εξίσταντο (they were astonished) was changed into εξεπλήσσοντο (they were astounded) against all other manuscripts.
B. H. Streeter, working largely on the basis of data supplied by Lake, proposed that Family 1, along with the Codex Koridethi (Θ), Family 13, the minuscules 28, 565, 700, and the Armenian and Georgian versions, were the remnants of what he labelled the Caesarean Text, differing in a number of common respects from the then established Byzantine, Western and Alexandrian text-types.
Silva Lake discovered that Minuscule 652 in Mark 4:20-6:24 represents text of the f1.
Amy Anderson made a new reconstruction of the family tree in 2004 and showed that minuscule 1582 is a more exact representation than 1 of the text of the archetype. She identified the Family 1 manuscripts in Matthew as 1, 22, 118, 131, 205, 209, 872, 1192, 1210, 1278, 1582, 2193 and 2542.
Alison Sarah Welsby, in her 2012 doctoral thesis, identified the Family 1 manuscripts in John as 1, 22, 118, 131, 205abs (2886), 205, 209, 565, 872, 884, 1192, 1210, 1278, 1582, 2193, 2372, and 2713.
Within the family, there are three manuscripts which may be more closely related. 209 was part of Cardinal Bessarion's collection by 1438 A.D., and may have served as the exemplar for 2866 (copied at his direction before 1468 A.D.) and 205 (copied at his direction after 1468 A.D.).
2866, before receiving its own Gregory-Aland number, was long assumed to be a direct copy of 205 and was thus named 205abs (from Abscrift, the German word for copy). D. C. Parker rehearsed Lake's views who thought 209 to have been the parent of 205, and then Parker rehearses Josef Schmid's (1956) views who considered 2866 and 205 to be daughters of 209's lost sister.
