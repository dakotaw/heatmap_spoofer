## 22d Intelligence Squadron

The 22d Intelligence Squadron (22 IS) is a non-flying squadron of the United States Air Force. It is assigned to the 707th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group, Fort George G. Meade, Maryland.
The 22 IS is one of the oldest units in the United States Air Force, its lineage and history consisting of two World War I Western Front combat squadrons.
The 22d Aero Squadron was organized on 16 June 1917 at Kelly Field, Texas. A Pursuit (Fighter) squadron of the American Expeditionary Forces, it took part in the Somme Defensive; St. Mihiel offensive, and Meuse-Argonne offensive campaigns. The unit was demobilized after the war in 1919.
The 135th Aero Squadron was organized on 1 August 1917 at Rockwell Field, California. A Corps Observation (Reconnaissance) squadron, it took part in the Somme Defensive; St. Mihiel offensive, and Meuse-Argonne offensive campaigns. It was re-designated as the 22d Observation Squadron in March 1921 as part of the permanent United States Army Air Service.
The two units were consolidated in April 1937. During World War II, the squadron became part of Ninth Air Force in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) as a tactical reconnaissance squadron. During the Cold War, it was part of Tactical Air Command.
