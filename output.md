## Human Rights League (Dutch-speaking Belgium)

The Human Rights League for speakers of Dutch in Belgium is by them called Liga voor Mensenrechten.
The in 1901 founded national organisation Ligue des Droits de l'Homme had been dissolved during World War I and its successor by World War II. It was recreated in 1954 as the Ligue Belge pour la Défense des Droits de l’Homme that was split in 1978 internally, and since 1982 officially, into the French-speaking Ligue des droits de l'homme and the in this article described Dutch-speaking Liga voor Mensenrechten (LVM).
The Liga voor Mensenrechten is associated with the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH). The LVM is also associated with the European League for Human Rights, abbreviated AEDH from its French name Association Européenne pour la défense des Droits de l'Homme.
