## Burnin' for You

"Burnin' for You" is a hit song by American hard rock band Blue Ã–yster Cult, from their Platinum Fire of Unknown Origin album, released in 1981.
It hit #1 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart, and the single spent three weeks in the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was aided by a popular early MTV music video. The song, like BOC's other hit songs "Godzilla" and "(Don't Fear) The Reaper", was sung by guitarist Buck Dharma, who also co-wrote the song.
The song was on the 2001 Clear Channel memorandum list of deemed "lyrically questionable" songs after 9/11.
