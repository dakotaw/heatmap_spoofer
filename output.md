## Emperor Zhi

Di Zhì (simplified Chinese: 帝挚; traditional Chinese: 帝摯; pinyin: Dì Zhì) or simply Zhì, was a mythological emperor of ancient China. Di was a title as in HuangDi "Yellow Emperor" and YanDi "Flame Emperor". Zhi was a son of DiKu "Emperor Ku". Di Zhi ruled for nine years (roughly 2366- 2358 BC) until he died and was succeeded by his younger half-brother Yao. Sima Qian, in the ShiJi (the Records of the Grand Historian), says in its section on the "Annals of the Five Di", that Zhi reigned badly and died, and his brother FangXun, 'the highly meritorious one', then reigned under the title of Di Yao. The Bamboo Annals says that when Emperor Zhuanxu died, a descendent of Shennong named ShuQe raised a disturbance, but was destroyed by the prince of Sin, who was Ku (GaoXin), a descendant of HuangDi, who then ascended to the throne. In the 45th year, Ku designated the prince of Tang (唐) (his son Yao) as his successor, however upon his death in the 63rd year, his elder son Zhi then took the throne instead, ruling nine years before being deposed and replaced by Yao.
