## The Boat Race of the North

The Boat Race of the North is an annual rowing event between the boat clubs of Durham and Newcastle universities in England. The event is staged on the River Tyne in Newcastle.
The inaugural event took place on 18 May 1997. Durham has won eight of the twelve competitions. In 2009 Newcastle took the overall title for the first time and in 2010 the event was a draw. The event was sponsored for a number of years until 2010 by Northumbrian Water, and hence was known as the Northumbrian Water University Boat Race for this period. No races took place over the period 2011 â€“ 2014, but the race resumed in 2015. Since 2015 the race had been sponsored by the NE1 business development company.
